This is a readme to the Practical Machine Learning project.

The project is collected in only 1 R script.

A r MarkDown file is delivered which contains the details of achieving the requirements


All the requirements was delivered..

The Steps of the Solution:
1- loading required libraries

2- Reading training data and testing data

3- Determine which model to choose to predict "classe" by graphing
some of the predictors in a feature plot.

4- By Viewing the data, we see that some variables do
not contribute in our target variable(classe) so let's get rid of them

5- Cross Validation Using Random Subsampling and Random Forest

6- Applying the Random Forest Model to the 20 Test Cases
